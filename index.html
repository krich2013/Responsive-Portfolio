                        <p>After years of consulting in the <span style="color: #4aaaa5"> technology and innovation</span> space, I currently work in product management, where I am responsible for end to end product development and growth across multiple technology stacks.  I operate at the intersection of business, design, and engineering to build meaningful experiences that drive bottom line growth.  I particularly enjoy leading complex, business critical products to ensure that products are delivered on time and at the highest quality. My current role is leading the backend product team at the world's largest publisher.</p>

                        <p>When I started in the <span style="color: #4aaaa5"> digital media</span> industry, I worked on the frontend team, across some of the top brands in the world to optimize the frontend for SEO, user experience, and revenue.  My data driven approach and solutions orientation drove millions of dollars in incremental revenue for the organization.  I then moved to the data management and editorial experience team, where I run a team of multiple product managers responsible for building easy to use edit tools and migrating normalized data into the new content management system. </p>

                        <p>A <span style="color: #4aaaa5">creative thinker</span> at heart, I am passionate about using technology and innovation to positively impact the user experience.  I have successfully launched many products, evidence of which can be found in my products' WSJ features or in the significant revenue growth my products have generated. By championing human-centric approaches to identifying and solving the most challenging technology problems, I have helped many digital teams conceptualize, prototype, market test, and build cutting edge products. </p>

                        <p>I am constantly seeking <span style="color: #4aaaa5"> new experiences</span> in my professional and personal life.  In my free time, I can be found running a new trail in the foothills of Colorado.  As soon as ski season starts, I dedicate my Sundays to skiing new trails all around the Colorado mountains.  My puppy is my partner in crime, and he accompanies me to work in exchange for fetch time at the park. </p>
